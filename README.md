| **Projects** | **Description** | **Notes** |
| -------------------- | :--------------------- |:---------------------------|
| Languages models. Speech Tagger| The task is part-of-speech (POS) tagging using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). | Numpy, Pandas, Torch, TorchText, Sklearn, Nltk, Tqdm, Matplotlib |
|NLP Embeddings | Using embeddings to solve the task of semantic classification of tweets. To achieve this, we will utilize pre-trained word2vec embeddings. | Numpy, Pandas, Torch, Sklearn, Nltk, Gensim, Tqdm, Matplotlib |
| NLP Spoken language Processing | The task is to train a classifier for age classification based on voice. | Numpy, Pandas, Torch, TorchText, Sklearn, Nltk, Tqdm, Matplotlib|
| NLP Text Classification | The task is to try several methods used in classification, as well as to understand how well the model comprehends the meaning of words and which words in the example influence the result | Numpy,  Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Torch, TorchText, Tqdm|
| Simple embeddings|The task is to rank StackOverflow questions based on semantic vector representations | Numpy, Pandas, Gensim, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Torch, Wordcloud, Tqdm |
|Toxic Comments BERT |The task is to train a model to classify comments as positive or negative. We have a dataset labeled for the toxicity of edits. | Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Torch, Nltk, Transformers, Wordcloud, Tqdm, Textwrap3 |
|Toxic Comments kaggle |Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments. | Numpy, Pandas, Nltk, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Torch, Transformers, Wordcloud, Tqdm |
|Transformers. GPT2 |As a result of the work done, we gained experience in interacting with transformer models and the HuggingFace library. We needed to solve a simple sentiment analysis task using the GPT-2 model| Numpy, Matplotlib, Torch, Transformers, Tqdm |
